Image classification using CNN

This project involves implementing a Convolutional Neural Network model for classifying images depicting hand gestures of American Sign Language (ASL). The images were downloaded from Kaggle and pre-processed to form a labelled dataset that could be used for image classification task.

The CNN model was trained and validated on 70% and 15% of data, respectively. The model gave training accuracy of 100%, whereas a validation accuracy of 94.16%. The trained model was further tested on the rest 15% of data giving a prediction accuracy of 93.39%. The model was tuned by changing the values of various hyper parameters, such as optimizers, loss functions, learning rate, filter size, number of convolutional layers, etc. The best hyper parameters giving the highest validation and test accuracy have been choosen for the final model.
